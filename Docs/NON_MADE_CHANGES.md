# Non-Functioning Items (2026-01-27)

## Landing Page
- The hero “Watch Demo” button is wired to `demoRef`, but no element ever sets that ref, so the click does nothing and no demo is revealed.
- There is still no recorded walkthrough, animated microsite, or interactive preview behind the Watch Demo CTA, so nothing meaningful happens when the user taps it.

## Generator Experience
- Preview logs and runtime errors generated by the agent are not yet surfaced inside the new chat workspace, so the timeline and final reasoning sections can feel opaque when builds fail.
