Remember the helper rulebooks: keep files small, updates immutable, validate every user input, avoid console.log, never hardcode secrets, run unit/integration/E2E flows, and keep the immediate WOW effect alive (header, hero, features, social proof, CTA, footer). Highlight any missing or broken sections/tests/build/security first, then suggest concrete next steps before marking ready for release. Use this context to populate the JSON schema described in the system prompt.
