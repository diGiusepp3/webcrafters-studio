PLAN TO FOLLOW (DERIVED FROM REASONING AGENT):
{{PLAN_TEXT}}

EXECUTION PLAN (FOLLOW THIS EVEN IF USER IS VAGUE):
- Deliver a complete, runnable project.
- Ensure the first viewport has a WOW effect AND the project has depth (real multi-page flows).
- Follow the reasoning plan's pages/routes and API outline.
- Use strong layout structure AND multiple routed pages (not just a landing).
- Use mock data and graceful fallbacks so the UI always renders even without a backend.

FRONTEND COMPLETENESS CHECKLIST:
- Navigation links route to real pages and/or scroll to real sections.
- Primary and secondary CTAs are present and visually distinct.
- Cards, grids, and sections have consistent spacing and alignment.
- Typography scale is intentional (clear headline, subhead, body, captions).
- The footer contains at least: brand, quick links, and a small legal/help row.

MULTI-PAGE DEPTH CHECKLIST:
- At least 4 meaningful routes/pages (or screens/commands for mobile/cli).
- One data-driven listing page with filtering + a detail view.
- One form flow page with validation and good UX (errors, disabled states).
- Shared layout (AppShell) and consistent components across pages.

IMPORTANT:
- Output ONLY valid JSON matching the required schema.
- Include all files needed to run and build.
