EXECUTION PLAN (FOLLOW THIS EVEN IF USER IS VAGUE):
- Deliver a complete, runnable project.
- If this is frontend-oriented, prioritize a single outstanding landing page.
- Ensure the first viewport has a WOW effect.
- Use strong layout structure: header -> hero -> features -> social proof -> CTA -> footer.
- Use mock data and static content so the UI always renders.

FRONTEND COMPLETENESS CHECKLIST:
- Navigation links scroll to real sections.
- Primary and secondary CTAs are present and visually distinct.
- Cards, grids, and sections have consistent spacing and alignment.
- Typography scale is intentional (clear headline, subhead, body, captions).
- The footer contains at least: brand, quick links, and a small legal/help row.

IMPORTANT:
- Output ONLY valid JSON matching the required schema.
- Include all files needed to run and build.
