PLAN TO FOLLOW (DERIVED FROM REASONING AGENT):
{{PLAN_TEXT}}

EXECUTION PLAN (FOLLOW THIS EVEN IF USER IS VAGUE):
- Deliver a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE project with real routed flows.
- Make the first viewport WOW while still shipping depth (multi-page, data + forms).
- Follow the reasoning plan's IA/routes and API outline exactly.
- Use strong layout structure, shared AppShell, and consistent components.
- Use mock data + graceful fallbacks so the UI ALWAYS renders without backend.
- Add README + env examples + build.manifest.json aligned to structure.

FRONTEND COMPLETENESS CHECKLIST:
- Navigation links route to real pages and/or scroll to real sections.
- Primary and secondary CTAs are present and visually distinct above the fold.
- Cards, grids, and sections have consistent spacing and alignment.
- Typography scale is intentional (clear headline, subhead, body, captions).
- Footer contains brand + quick links + legal/help row.
- Provide loading, empty, and error states for lists/details.
- Add skeleton loaders for first paint; use toasts or inline alerts instead of console.log.
- Reuse design tokens (colors/radii/shadows) and keep components consistent.

MULTI-PAGE DEPTH CHECKLIST:
- >=4 meaningful routes/pages (or screens/commands for mobile/cli).
- One data-driven listing page with filtering + a detail view.
- One form flow page with validation, errors, disabled/success states.
- Shared layout (AppShell) and consistent components across pages.
- Include a CRUD-like flow (create/edit/delete) using mock data when needed.

TESTING & BUILD CHECKLIST:
- Add Vitest unit tests for key components/utils and Playwright e2e smoke (for web).
- Backend (if present): pytest for core endpoints/auth.
- package.json scripts: dev, build, preview, test, lint, e2e (when applicable).
- Ensure build.manifest.json matches actual folders.

IMPORTANT:
- Output ONLY valid JSON matching the required schema.
- Include ALL files needed to run and build.
