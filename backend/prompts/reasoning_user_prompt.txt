Use the design guidelines and helper rulebook provided earlier. Analyze the request and produce the JSON schema described in the system prompt. When drafting pages, API endpoints, and steps, surface:
- Brand feel (tone, color accents), primary audience, and the #1 CTA to emphasize.
- Key data entities, sample attributes, and any integrations/auth implied.
- Critical UX flows (list/detail, form with validation, dashboard/analytics if relevant).
- Edge cases and state coverage (loading, empty, error, success).
